# Continuous-sign-language-recognition
This project describes a new deep learning architecture to recognize Sign Language and thistechnique is the combination of deep learning CNN (convolution neural networks), (Recurrent Neural Network Model called BILSTM (Bidirectional Neural Network) to improve sign language recognition.
